<!-- After create an html.html file, 
  ALWAYS the first line of code will be this one: -->
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This tag tell the browser which HTML version should use to render this document.-->
<!-- After we declare the doctype, we need to provide an <html> element: -->
<html lang="en">
    <!-- The <head> element is where we put important meta-information 
     about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render 
     correctly in the browser-->
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My webpages number 582</title>
  </head>
    <!-- The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the 
     <body> element. This is where all the content that will be displayed 
     to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.-->
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
    <h2>My first website</h2>
  </body>

</html>
